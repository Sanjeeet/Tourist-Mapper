- Implemented a function to find the closest path between 2 user-input points on the map using Dijkstra’s and A-Star      Algorithms (use of priority queue and adjacency matrix)
- Implemented a greedy Courier Path finding algorithm
- Made use of  various code testing methods and analysis such as profiling, code coverage and unit-testing
